<section anchor="problems" title="Introduction">

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis"/> defines the Multipath TCP.
However, the lifetime of idle Multipath-level connections was barely discussed.</t>

<t>There are several situations in which a host want to adjust the idle lifetime.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='use case 1:'>
  A host that wants to extend the lifetime of a connection for the desired duration
MAY request its peer to apply a high session timeout value. This is probably the main
use case of using the idle lifetime option.</t>
  <t hangText='use case 2:'>
  On the other hand, by reducing this value, a highly-loaded server can quickly
terminate currently unused MPTCP connections. It can send an MPTCP option
to signal its peers that the connections will be closed shortly.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="need" title="The Need for Standardization">

<t>An MPTCP-enabled host may have its own timing-out policy for idle sessions.
However, in many cases, it is necessary to exchange the idle timeout value.
The standard way to extend Multipath TCP is using MPTCP option,
which requires the standardization.</t>

<t>For regular TCP, extending the connection lifetime by increasing 
the idle timeout value is usually not enough since it is common 
that the NAT/middleboxes on the path could explicitly or silently
terminate the connection.</t>

<t>For Multipath TCP, this is a much lesser problem since the closure
of one or all subflows do not terminate the multipath-level session.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>In this document, the key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”,
“SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”,
and “OPTIONAL” are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="define" title="MPTCP session timeout definitions">

<t>TODO: if we call it MPTCP (idle) session lifetime, it is easy to be confused with the
total duration of a session since the establishment to the closure.</t>

<t>There are different variances of MPTCP session timeout that could be exchanged.</t>

<t>One may think of MPTCP session timeout as the time elapsed since the last subflow
of the connection closed, i.e. the duration that there is no subflow alive.
However, two ends of a connection may have different views about the state
of each subflow, due to TCP RST (or FIN-ACK?) packet loss. Moreover, a middlebox
such as NAT may silently drop the subflow, 
while one end or both ends think the subflow is still alive.
It is necessary to implement an additional mechanism at the subflow level, e.g.
TCP Keepalive to make sure the subflow is alive.
This means that negotiating the no-subflow timeout between two ends is not enough
to prevent the MPTCP session from timing out (use case 1) due to middleboxes.</t>

<t>The alternative way is to exchange the MPTCP idle timeout (ITO), which is defined as the duration
since the last valid TCP packet received on any subflow of the established MPTCP session. Relying on
this value, MPTCP hosts do not need to worry about the middlebox interference
or TCP RST (or FIN-ACK?) packet loss.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="ops" title="Basic Operation">

<t>The operation of MPTCP ITO option is similar to the TCP UTO option (defined in <xref target="RFC5482"/>).</t>

<section anchor="ito-option-and-local-policies" title="ITO Option and Local Policies">

<t>Once receiving this option, the receiver MAY choose to accept this request.
 In this case, SHOULD respond with the same value and notify the application about the new ITO.</t>

<t>Alternatively, when it does not accept the requested value based on local policy,
 it MAY choose to either respond with its own current value or it MAY ignore the request if it comes from an untrusted peer.</t>

<t>When the initiator receives the ITO option with the same value, it SHOULD apply this same value to the connection.</t>

<t>However, the exchange of MPTCP Idle Timeout Option is not a binding negotiation.
A host may have a local policy that overrides the negotiated value, for example 
when it needs to terminate long idle connection due to the increasing memory resource pressure.</t>

<t>After the idle timeout fired, the host MAY choose to forcfully close
the MPTCP session with MPTCP_RST and all of its subflows with TCP_RST, and report the timeout error to the user.
This is a common case on the servers, who want to free the resource occupied by unused sessions 
as soon as possible so that they could serve other users.</t>

<t>Alternatively, before and after the idle timeout fired, the host MAY send TCP Keepalive probes
 if they want to reuse the current MPTCP session. This could be the case on client side.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ito-option-is-unreliable" title="ITO Option is Unreliable">

<t>MPTCP ITO Option does not require reliable handshaking, therefore, 
implementations MUST NOT assume that it is transferred reliably.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="format" title="Option Format">

<t>The specific format of the ITO option is depicted in Fig. <xref target="figformat"/>:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Granularity (1 bit):'>
  Flag to indicate the time resolution.
 When set (G = 1), the time value in “Idle Timeout” field 
 MUST be interpreted as minutes. Otherwise (G = 0), the
 “Idle Timeout” field MUST be interpreted as seconds.</t>
  <t hangText='Idle Timeout (16 bits):'>
  Specifies the requested Idle Timeout for the MPTCP session.
    The granularity of this time value (minutes or seconds)
    depends on the “G” field.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Alternatively, Experimental Multipath TCP option could be used but 
it have a larger option size than the normal one.</t>

<section anchor="implementation-and-interoperability" title="Implementation and Interoperability">

<section anchor="middleboxes" title="Middleboxes">

<t>MPTCP-agnostic middleboxes are unlikely to selectively remove MPTCP ITO options.
MPTCP-aware middleboxes may do that, though the motivation is unclear.
The request initiator may send TCP Keepalive periodically on any subflow to maintain the session,
or may re-establish the session when it detected the session was closed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="interaction-with-keepalives" title="Interaction with Keepalives">

<t>The interaction of the idle session lifetime with subflow-level Keepalives is not yet specified.
Note that with MPTCP enabled sessions, the subflow-level Keepalive is unlikely to be common.</t>

<t>On some MPTCP implementations like Linux, the TCP Keepalive is supported at the
MPTCP layer. To implement the idle timeout option, these implementations
may use the MPTCP KeepAliveTime value to keep track the current idle time. However,
the idle timeout mechanism, when activated, should overwrite the keepalive mechanism.
This means that after the idle timeout fired, the host should abort the connection
instead of sending the TCP keepalives.</t>

<t>MPTCP Idle Timeout Option MAY be controlled on a system-wide setting or 
on a per-connection basis. Specific APIs and mechanisms for controlling the ITO option
are out of the scope of this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="interaction-with-user-timeout" title="Interaction with User Timeout">

<t>The interaction of the idle session lifetime with MPTCP User Timeout is not yet specified.
Should we do that?
(<xref target="RFC5482"/> infers that Keepalive time must be higher than UTO.)</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>On-path attackers may insert an MPTCP option into all observed sessions
to increase the idle timeout to a very high value so that those un-closed
sessions may accumulate on the host and exhaust the system resources.</t>

<t>On the other hand, on-path attackers may try to reduce the idle timeout to
a very low value (e.g. one second), so that any session that experiences
a short idle duration would be dropped, effectively causes a type of DoS attack.</t>

<t>To mitigate this attack, the hosts supporting this option SHOULD restrict
the valid idle timeout value in a safe range. The hosts MAY either cap
the requested timeout value to the upper/lower threshold or just ignore it.</t>

<t>Furthermore, the hosts could limit the numbers of the long idle sessions,
When the system resources are under pressure, it could start shedding those
connections with longest idle time and from untrusted peers.</t>

<abstract><t>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure.  Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.  This document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as specified in RFC6824, through clarifications and modifications primarily driven by deployment experience.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The TCP user timeout controls how long transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before a connection is forcefully closed.  It is a local, per-connection parameter.  This document specifies a new TCP option -- the TCP User Timeout Option -- that allows one end of a TCP connection to advertise its current user timeout value.  This information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to adapt its user timeout accordingly.  Increasing the user timeouts on both ends of a TCP connection allows it to survive extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.  Decreasing the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their clients that they will maintain the connection state only for a short time without connectivity.
